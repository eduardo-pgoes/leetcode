# LeetCode

This is a repo for storing LeetCode solutions to problems I've attempted to solve, as well as a guide through my own rationale & brainstorming to solve them. The idea behind these is LeetCode problems can easily become themes for blog posts or videos if I find the problems or the topics required to solve them interesting enough.

I might also come back and solve these in other languges to pick up proficiency in their base libraries.

# Running solutions
For C++ solutions - `gcc {filepath}.cpp -lstdc++ && ./a.out`
